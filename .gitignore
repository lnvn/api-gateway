# Binaries for the current project
###################################

# Compiled binary (usually matches the module name or current directory name)
# Exclude the main executable file created by 'go build'
# For example, if your module is named 'my-app', this line would exclude the 'my-app' executable.
# You may need to replace 'my-app' with your actual project name if you use this line.
# If you run 'go build .', the binary is often named after the directory.
# This line is often safer to leave commented or deleted if you don't know the name.

# Go will create the executable in the root directory:
# my-app
# ./my-app

# Binaries for other packages built by 'go install' are typically in $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN
